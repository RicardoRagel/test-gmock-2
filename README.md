# Test-GMock-2

## Overview

This repository contains some tests using [GoogleMock](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html) together with CMake.

Please, refer first to my repository [test-gtest](https://github.com/RicardoRagel/test-gtest) to check how to setup and use Google Test, and to my other repository [test-gmock-1](https://github.com/RicardoRagel/test-gmock-1) to see some examples about GMock Matchers. The setup and usage of this repository is the same, the only difference is the kind of tests that it will be performed by the [example_test.cpp](test/example_test.cpp) file. 

In the case of this repository, we will use **gMock Classes**, defining them, and "test" if their "expectations" are accomplished.
